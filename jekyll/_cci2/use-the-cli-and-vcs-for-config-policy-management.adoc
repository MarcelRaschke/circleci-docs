NOTE: Config policy management is available on the **Scale** plan and is currently in **open preview**. All aspects of the feature are subject to change.

CAUTION: Ensure you have authenticated your version of the CLI with a token, and updated the CLI, before attempting to use the CLI for config policy management. See the link:/docs/local-cli[Installing the Local CLI] page for more information.

Use the CircleCI CLI to manage your organization's policies programmatically. The sub-commands to perform policy management are grouped under the `policy` command. 

The following sub-commands are currently supported within the CLI for configuration policy management:

* `diff` - shows the difference between local and remote policy bundles
* `push` - pushes the policy bundle (activate policy bundle)
* `fetch` - fetches the policy bundle (or one policy, based on name) from remote

For example, running the following command activates a policy bundle stored at `./policy_bundle_dir_path`:

[source,shell]
----
circleci policy push ./policy_bundle_dir_path --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

[NOTE]
====
The organization ID is required, and is provided with `--owner-id` flag. To find your organization/user ID, select **Organization Settings** in the CircleCI web app side bar.

[#create-and-upload-a-policy]
== Create and upload a policy 

Follow these steps to create a policy that checks the `version` of CircleCI config files to ensure it is greater than or equal to `2.1`.

. Create a policy file in an empty directory. For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Inside your new directory create a Rego file for our new policy, for example, `version.rego`.

. Add the following content to `version.rego`:
+
[source,rego]
----
# All policies start with the org package definition
package org

policy_name["example"]

# signal to circleci that check_version is enabled and must be included when making a decision
enable_rule["check_version"]

# signal to circleci that check_version is a hard_failure condition and that builds should be
# stopped if this rule is not satisfied.
hard_fail["check_version"]

# define check version
check_version = reason {
    not input.version # check the case where version is not in the input
    reason := "version must be defined"
} {
    not is_number(input.version) # check that version is number
    reason := "version must be a number"
} {
    not input.version >= 2.1 # check that version is at least 2.1
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.1 but got %s", [input.version])
}
----

. Upload your policy to your organization:
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci-cli policy push ./config-policies --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----
+
Now, when a pipeline is triggered within your organization, the project's `.circleci/config.yml` will be validated against this policy.

[#update-a-policy]
== Update a policy

To illustrate making a change to an existing policy, suppose you made an error when creating the policy above. You realise that configs in your organization are using CircleCI config version `2.0` and you want your policy to reflect this.

. Change the rule definition in your `version.rego` file:
+
[source,rego]
----
{
    not input.version >= 2.0 # check that version is at least 2.0
    reason := sprintf("version must be at least 2.0 but got %s", [input.version])
}
----

. Push the policy directory containing the updated policy file using the CLI (verify the diff, and choose yes when prompted):
+
[source,shell]
----
circleci-cli policy push ./config-policies --owner-id <your-organization-ID>
----

[#manage-policies-with-your-vcs]
== Manage policies with your VCS

CircleCI policies are managed by pushing directories of policies to CircleCI via the CLI. The recommended method for managing your policy directory is by storing them in a repository in your VCS, within your organization. This is how policies are managed internally at CircleCI. Pushing policy bundles is done by triggering CircleCI pipelines.

We recommend creating a bot account for pushing policies, and using its associated CircleCI personal API token for authentication. For maximum security the token should be stored as an environment variable within a context, and that context should be restricted to groups that are responsible for managing policies. For more information, see the link:/docs/contexts[Using Contexts] page.

[set-up-a-config-policy-management-ci-pipeline]
=== Set up a config policy management CI pipeline

. Set up repository in your VCS to manage policies.

. Create a directory for your Rego policy files, for example:
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ./config-policies
----

. Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file for your policies repository, and copy and paste the config example below. This example pushes policies to CircleCI on commits to the `main` branch, and shows a diff of the policy bundle on commits to all other branches:
+
[source,yaml]

version: 2.1

orbs:
  circleci-cli: circleci/circleci-cli@0.1.9 # Use orb to make the `circleci-cli/default` executor available for running jobs

workflows:
  main-workflow:
    jobs:
      - diff-policy-bundle:
          context: <my-context>
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: main # on all branches other than main
      - push-policy-bundle:
          context: <my-context>
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main # only on the main branch

jobs:
  diff-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Diff policy bundle
          command: circleci policy diff ./config --owner-id $ORG_ID # show a diff of the policy bundle

  push-policy-bundle:
    executor: circleci-cli/default
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Push policy bundle
          command: circleci policy push ./config --no-prompt --owner-id $ORG_ID # push the policy bundle to CircleCI
----

NOTE: `$ORG_ID` is an environment variable to store the organiztion ID. 

NOTE: The context for each job is `<my-context>`. This context name is arbitrary, but it must declare the environment variable `CIRCLECI_CLI_TOKEN` to authenticate the CLI.
