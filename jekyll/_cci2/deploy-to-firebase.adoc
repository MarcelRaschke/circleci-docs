= Deploy to Firebase

This page provides a configuration for deployment to Firebase. In order to deploy to Firebase you will need to add `firebase-tools` to your project's devDependencies since attempting to install `firebase-tools` globally in CircleCI will not work.

```shell
npm install --save-dev firebase-tools
```

Generate a Firebase CLI token using the following command:

```shell
firebase login:ci
```

Add the generated token to the CircleCI project's environment variables as `$FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN`. {% include snippets/env-var-or-context.adoc %}

The following example shows how you can add a deploy to Firebase job to your project's `.circleci/config.yml` file. This snippet assumes you already have a job to build your application, called `build-job`, and introduces a deployment workflow that only runs the deployment job once the build job has completed **and** you are on the main branch.

```yaml
  deploy-job:
    docker:
      - image: <docker-image-name-tag>
        auth:
          username: mydockerhub-user
          password: $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD  # context / project UI env-var reference
    working_directory: /tmp/my-project
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Deploy Main to Firebase
          command: ./node_modules/.bin/firebase deploy --token=$FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN

workflows:
  version: 2
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - build-job
      - deploy-job:
          requires:
            - build-job
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main

```

If you are using Google Cloud Functions with Firebase, instruct CircleCI to navigate to the folder where the Google Cloud Functions are held (in this case 'functions') and run `npm install` by adding the below to `.circleci/config.yml`:

```yaml
    - run: cd functions && npm install
```
