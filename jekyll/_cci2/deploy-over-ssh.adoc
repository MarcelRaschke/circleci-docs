To configure CircleCI to deploy your application over SSH, follow the steps below.

1. Add the SSH key for the server to which you're deploying. For instructions, see the <<add-ssh-key#,Adding an SSH Key to CircleCI>> document.
2. Add the SSH username and SSH hostname of your build VM as environment variables. For instructions, see the <<set-environment-variable#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project,Set an environment variable in a project>> documentation. In this example, these variables are defined as `SSH_USER` and `SSH_HOST`, respectively.
3. In your `.circleci/config.yml`, create a `deploy` job and add a command to deploy the main branch.

```yaml
version: 2

jobs:
    build:
    #...
    deploy:
    machine:
        enabled: true
    steps:
        - run:
            name: Deploy Over SSH
            command: |
            ssh $SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST "<remote deploy command>"

workflows:
    version: 2
    build-and-deploy:
    jobs:
        - build
        - deploy:
            requires:
            - build # only deploy once build job has completed
            filters:
            branches:
                only: main # only deploy on the main branch
```
